BLE-Verbindungsaufbau basiert auf:

> ### Adafruit Android BLE UART
> 
> Example code for interacting with a Bluefruit Bluetooth LE UART in an Android application.  Run the application and it will connect to the first available Bluetooth LE UART found to provide a simple console for sending and receiving data.  Try testing with a Bluefruit LE configured to run the echoDemo!
> 
> **This code requires the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) (0.8 beta) to build.**  Download the repository and use the 'Import project...' option to load the directory as a project in Android Studio.  The code will not work with the legacy Eclipse-based ADT build environment!
> 
> **Warning:** This is alpha/beta quality software and only serves as an example of how to use a Bluetooth LE UART in an Android application!  Bluetooth LE support is somewhat flakey in Android so it is _highly recommended_ that you upgrade to the absolute latest version of Android possible (ideally 4.4.4+) and use hardware that is known to be somewhat reliable like a Nexus device.
